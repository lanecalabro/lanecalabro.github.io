CU Boulder | Spring 2013
For my final design project for the landscape emphasis semester, I designed a boardwalk that extended over a marshy area on CU Boulderâ€™s East Campus. It was designed to facilitate a learning environment which was appropriate for all ages. The emphasis for the design was on the planting plan, which used plants that would be appropriate for the climate as well as have staggered blooming seasons. All plant illustrations are sketched in ink and colored pencil.
