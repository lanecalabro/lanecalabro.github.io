CU Boulder | Summer 2014
In my time at CU Boulder, I had the opportunity to take a 5 week Digital Fabrication class where I designed a lighting installation for a coffee shop using DigiFab methods. My installation was designed using Rhino and Grasshopper. My physical model represented a 2’x4’ segment of my
design. I first constructed a simple frame and lighting system, which I spray painted pink as a backdrop for the sheathing which is constructed of about 100 laser cut paper ‘cells,’ which I attached to one another using a tabbed connection. I then was able to manipulate the form
of the paper sheathing and fix it to the frame using brads.
