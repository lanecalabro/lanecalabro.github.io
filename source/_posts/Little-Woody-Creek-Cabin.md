For this cabin remodel outside Aspen, CO I spear-headed the field measuring and drafting for permit submittal. Since no original drawings of the cabin existed, I measured and drew up existing plans then worked closely with the owner in order to come up with a new interior layout. After many iterations, the cabin's new purpose will be as a guesthouse.
