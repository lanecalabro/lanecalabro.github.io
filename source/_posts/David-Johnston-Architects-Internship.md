Aspen, CO | Summer 2013
The image to the left is a model I built during my last week at the ﬁrm to be used in a presentation for the Design Review Board. Below is a sketch I produced for a penthouse suite in the Jerome Professional Building. I spent the majority of my summer working on this building, and it is currently under construction directly behind the well-known hotel Jerome in Aspen. For this building speciﬁcally, I also worked extensively on imagery boards for the clients as well as process renderings using mainly SketchUp and Photoshop. I also edited construction documents in ArchiCAD and helped layout the necessary space for HVAC and other mechanical equipment. I spent most of my time at DJA working in SketchUp, taking part in client meetings, and red-lining construction documents in ArchiCAD.
