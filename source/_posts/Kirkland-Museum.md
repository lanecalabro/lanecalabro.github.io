Living Design Studios Inc. | Summer 2017
For this steel fence and gate designed by Olson Kundig Architects, I worked closely with the fabrication team at Living Design Studios in order to create a building method that would meet the exceedingly tight tolerance of the project. Although the design was conceptualized by the Architect, there were many gaps to fill when it came to construction. We ended up installing the fence in 4' sections that could be individually leveled. The gate, which was 600lbs when completed, also required extreme precision in fabrication and installation.
