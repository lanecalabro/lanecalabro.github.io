BG Design | Summer 2019
For this single family residence located in Carbondale, CO I was responsible for all architectural permit documents and drawings. This included coordination with the design team, structural engineer and homeowner. I also provided drawings for the subdivision design review board, meeting their many rigorous design standards. Drawings were all packaged based upon client standards to remain cohesive with what BG Design is known to provide.
