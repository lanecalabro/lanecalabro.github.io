Living Design Studios | Winter 2016
This project is located within Dairy Block in downtown Denver. Although this was only a small portion of the overall scope of our work on the project, it is one of the main centerpieces as it surrounds the Poka Lola Lounge. I spearheaded the design and drafting of this blackened steel and glass wall assembly as well as the the steel and glass at the entry to the hotel. My colleague was responsible for the design and drafting for the Kachina wall system, so we were working closely on all systems. Other scope items I worked on at this location included railings, guardrails, stair cladding, and signage. I was on site for field measuring and coordination many time throughout the project.
