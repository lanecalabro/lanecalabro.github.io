For this 480 SF hunting cabin, I worked closely with Mark Ward and Associates to create a design based upon the owner's hand sketch. I was responsible for coordination of details and design, and permit set drawings for Pitkin County. The cabin will be built upon an existing foundation, which I measured and adapted my design to fit. The minimalist design fits seamlessly within the serene mountain landscape that surrounds it.
