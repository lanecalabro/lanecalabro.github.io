Living Design Studios Inc. | Summer 2017
For this unique and challenging project, I managed the design and coordination from contract signing through completion including site visits and measuring using a Leica 3D Disto. I worked closely with our fabrication team to develop a system to link the panels together from the backside in order to achieve the client's request of no visible fasteners. The copper is ⅛” thick with an antique patina. The project also required some coordination with the lighting subs on the job as a chandelier is intended to hang down the center to illuminate the custom staircase below.
