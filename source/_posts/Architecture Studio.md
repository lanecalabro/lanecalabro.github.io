My final project for the architecture emphasis semester was to design a small building to be located in Denver, CO. The building was designed as a public space to house NPRâ€™s StoryCorps. We were given a specific program and in my design I chose to create a procession throughout the site which slowly transforms from profane to sacred as one passes through the main building, enters the exterior courtyard and finally reaches the recording booth, which
which is separated from the rest of the program. All drawings were done with ink and graphite on strathmore. The section perspective is populated using imagery printed on sticky-back.
