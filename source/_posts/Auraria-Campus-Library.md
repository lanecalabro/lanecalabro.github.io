For this project made up of 120 custom WaterJet cut and powdercoated aluminum panels, I worked mostly on design and approval/fabrication drawings. However, I also had a hand in field measuring and assisting with Project Management to track progress and keep the contractors and architect on board throughout the process. The project also incorporated a polycarbonate panel system and gutters over the two entrances and I designed this working closely with our subcontractors, Colorado Seamless Gutters and Skylight Specialists Inc.
