Living Design Studios Inc. | Summer 2016
For one of my favorite projects in my time at LDSi, I was able to work closely with the owner based on inspiration photos she had compiled to make her dream a reality. The structure is all steel with custom WaterJet cut panels for the roof and powdercoated. The design also features removable rails for curtains, hooks for hanging plants, and wiring access for (4) sunbelt outdoor heaters. I headed all design as well as coordination management on this project.
