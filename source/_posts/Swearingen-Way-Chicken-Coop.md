Divide Creek Builders Inc. | Summer 2018
For this chicken coop located near Basalt, CO I worked closely with the owner and builder in order to create a clean, Western-style coop that could accommodate a 30 chicken flock. I waded through heaps of information on the best chicken coops in order to create the ideal nesting and living conditions for the chickens based upon climate and orientation of the coop.
