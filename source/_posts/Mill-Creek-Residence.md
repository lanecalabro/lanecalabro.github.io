The design of these enclosures were a study in extremely tight tolerances both from a material standpoint as well as a client standpoint. This residence worked with exceedingly tight tolerances (down to the 1/32‚Äù) on all scope items. The formed copper panels were adhered to a plywood substrate which surrounded all sides. The frames were aluminum and the CT shed also featured custom aluminum hinges to allow the doors to lift off. The three enclosures I spearheaded were the CT Shed, the Gas Meter Enclosure and the Trash Enclosure. I also did the rework for the copper cladding on the garage doors. All copper cladding received an antique finish.
