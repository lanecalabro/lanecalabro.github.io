CU Boulder | Summer 2014
During the summer of 2014, I spent five weeks doing a global seminar in La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico with 12 Environmental Design and Environmental Studies students. The first two weeks were devoted to analysis of the city and learning about the history and culture of La Paz. The last three weeks, we were given free reign to create a design proposal that ultimately would be presented to the community members of La Paz. My partner and I chose a vacant, government owned lot at the base of Cerro Atra Vezazo and created a public space that would help expose the community to the existing system of hiking trails on Cerro Atra Vezazo and support the existing biking community.
