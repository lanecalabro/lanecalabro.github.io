Lane Marie Design LLC | Fall 2019 - Winter 2020
For this remodel I was approached by the owner to prepare drawings for permit. No prior drawings existed for the home, so first I measured the home and produced as-built drawings. From there, I worked closely with the homeowner, the structural engineer and HVAC and Electrical subcontractors to create a design that fit the needs of the family. The building permit was issued February of 2020 and I can't wait to watch this remodel take off! It is always a pleasure to work on projects in my own neighborhood.
