This design was based upon original historic drawings from the early 1800â€™s. Although the original was forged from steel, this redesign was a more modern take built in aluminum. The assembly was a combination of forged and WaterJet cut aluminum which all was clear anodized to ensure the longest life without wear. I did all design drawings and management on this project.
