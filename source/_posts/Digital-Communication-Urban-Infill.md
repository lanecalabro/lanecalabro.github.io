CU Boulder | Spring 2012
For this urban infill project, we were instructed to design a small gallery space that would truly be urban infill - buildings were existing on either side, so the only the roof and north and south sides of the project were available for outdoor air and light exposure. I chose to create an experience which would facilitate meandering through the gallery - it was driven by the idea that experiencing art in this building would be a slow, solitary, and reflective experience. The linearity of the building is highlighted by the unique shadows created by the picture window on the south side of the building which is the only source of direct light. Drawings are ink on mylar and model is museum board.
