CU Boulder | Fall 2014
For my final studio semester, I designed an adult education and teen center in Tatitlek, AK, a small maritime community of about 65 people. I choose to separate the two given programs - allotting the ground floor for adult education and the more open plan located on the upper floor for the teen center. The simplicity of my design was driven by the limited availability and high cost of building materials and the influence of the surrounding context structures.
