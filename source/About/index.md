Lane Marie Design was founded in 2018 by its owner and sole employee, Lane Calabro. Lane is a Colorado native with a strong passion for design and the environment. After graduating with a Bachelorâ€™s of Environmental Design with an emphasis in Architecture from CU Boulder in 2014, Lane went on to work for three years with Living Design Studios in Lafayette, CO. There, she was exposed to all aspects of the design and construction industry working on many complex projects of various scales and timelines. After taking on a management role and aiding in the rebuilding of the drafting department at LDSi, the time came to shift gears in order to pursue her architecture licensure and long-time goal of founding her own design company.

Lane is well-versed in metalwork design, architectural drafting, on-site coordination and construction management. Her program proficiencies include Rhinoceros, Sketch-Up, Blubeam Revu, Smartsheets and Adobe Creative Suite with some experience in Revit, ArchiCAD, AutoCAD and Grasshopper.

In her free time, Lane enjoys spending as much time in the mountains as possible skiing, hiking, backpacking and camping. She also aims to travel as much as she can in order to experience different cultures and design ideals to bring home and apply to her own projects.
